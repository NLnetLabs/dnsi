# dnsi – A tool to investigate the DNS

`dnsi` is a command line tool to investigate various aspects of the
Domain Name System (DNS).

It is currently in a very early state and will expand over the coming
months.

The tool contains a number of commands. Currently, these are:

* `dnsi query` sends a query to a name server or the system’s default
  resolver.
* `dnsi help` displays the man page for any command.
